h1. README

p. This is a example for a Hibernate Many-to-Many relationship with a composed primary key. The code is mostly from <a href="http://boris.kirzner.info/blog/archives/2008/07/19/hibernate-annotations-the-many-to-many-association-with-composite-key/">an blog post by Boris Kirzner</a> but I added another foreign key to create a bigger composed key. I also added database creation and insert SQL code to the project which was not mentioned in the blog post.

p. Hope this helps someone as it helped me.

h2. How to run it

# Create new MySQL database and run code in <code>database.sql</code>
# Edit hibernate.cfg.xml with your MySQL connection information
